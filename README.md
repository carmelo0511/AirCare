# 🌬️ AirCare

**AirCare** is a cloud-native web application that provides real-time air quality data (AQI) for people with asthma or respiratory sensitivity.  
It leverages a 100% serverless AWS architecture and integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API.

This project is fully automated: every push to GitHub updates both the frontend (S3/CloudFront) and the backend (AWS Lambda) via CI/CD with GitHub Actions. No manual deployments required.

---

## Deployment on CloudFront

The static frontend of AirCare is hosted and distributed via Amazon CloudFront. You can access the live version of the project at:

[https://d1wvrgloixxub.cloudfront.net](https://d1wvrgloixxub.cloudfront.net)

This CloudFront distribution points to the S3 bucket configured to serve all HTML, CSS, JS, and static assets. On every push to the `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically:

1. Syncs the local contents of the `frontend/` folder to the S3 bucket.
2. Invalidates the CloudFront cache to ensure the latest changes are served immediately.

## DynamoDB AQI History (NEW)

AirCare **persists all AQI lookups** to a DynamoDB table (`AirCareHistoryAQI`).  
Each time a user requests air quality for a city or location, the following data is stored :
- Location (`lat,lon`)
- Timestamp (ISO format)
- AQI value
- Particulate data (PM2.5, PM10, etc.)
- Health advice

A dedicated endpoint (`/history`) allows the frontend to **display the full AQI history** for any location.  
This enables analytics, trends, and potential dashboards (QuickSight integration is the next step).

## 🧱 Cloud Architecture (diagram)

![AirCare Architecture](assets1/diagramme1.png)

**Current stack:**

⚡ Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
☁️ Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js)
🌐 API Gateway: Handles endpoints /air, /geo/direct, /geo/reverse, /history
🗃️ DynamoDB: Stores AQI history for analytics & dashboards
🔒 API key secured (OpenWeatherMap) via Lambda proxy
🔐 Amazon Cognito: Manages user authentication & authorization
🔍 CloudWatch logs for backend observability
⚠️ CloudWatch Alarm + SNS Email alert on Lambda error
📦 S3: Static assets hosting

---

## 🖥️ Backend Lambda

All AWS Lambda source code is included in the [`backend/`](./backend/) folder.

- **Language:** Node.js 18.x (uses AWS SDK v3, native `fetch()`)
- **Endpoints handled:**
  - `/geo/direct` – City autocomplete (OpenWeatherMap API)
  - `/geo/reverse` – Reverse geocoding (coordinates → city)
  - `/air` – Air Quality Index (AQI) for a location or city (stores each lookup in DynamoDB)
  - `/history` – Fetch AQI lookup history from DynamoDB for a specific location
- **Features:**
  - Persists each AQI lookup to DynamoDB (`AirCareHistoryAQI`)
  - Adds tailored health advice for each AQI level
  - Handles errors and logs all requests to CloudWatch
  - Enforces English responses from OpenWeather
  - `/history` decodes and normalizes the `location` parameter for reliable lookups
  - API keys and table names are **never hardcoded** (managed with environment variables)
- **How to deploy:**  
  1. Edit the code in [`backend/index.js`](./backend/index.js)  
  2. Zip the contents of `backend/` and upload to AWS Lambda (or automate via CI/CD)  
  3. See comments in `index.js` for full code explanations

## Development

### Local setup

1. Install **Node.js 18** or newer.
2. Clone this repository and install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carmelo0511/AirCare.git
   cd AirCare/backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Set your OpenWeatherMap API key in the `OPENWEATHER_APIKEY` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENWEATHER_APIKEY=your_api_key
   ```
4. (Optional) Set the DynamoDB table name used by the Lambda via `TABLE_NAME`.
   If not set, it defaults to **AirCareHistoryAQI**:
   ```bash
   export TABLE_NAME=AirCareHistoryAQI
   ```
5. Run the backend test suite to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
6. Set the API endpoint for the frontend:
   ```bash
   API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint node scripts/set-api-url.js
   ```
7. Generate the Cognito configuration for the frontend:
   ```bash
   COGNITO_REGION=your-region \
   COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=pool-id \
   COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=client-id \
   COGNITO_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth.region.amazoncognito.com \
   node scripts/set-cognito-config.js
   ```
   Make sure the **Cognito domain** and callback URLs are correctly configured
   in the AWS console. If they don't match your site URL, the Hosted UI shows
   “Something went wrong. An error was encountered with the requested page.”
   After adjusting the domain or URLs, rerun the script above to regenerate
   `frontend/cognito-config.js`.
8. Serve the frontend locally from the project root:
   ```bash
   npx http-server frontend -c-1
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The generated
   `frontend/config.js` now points the app to the correct backend.
### Changing the API endpoint

If you deploy your own backend or API Gateway, set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable and run:
```bash
node scripts/set-api-url.js
```
This regenerates `frontend/config.js` with your endpoint. Because the frontend imports this value at runtime, no application code changes are required.

## ✅ Security

- The API key is **never exposed** to the client
- AWS IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
- No secrets hardcoded in the repo (managed via GitHub Secrets)

---

## 🚧 Upcoming Improvements

- 📊 Build a **QuickSight Dashboard** for AQI trends (from DynamoDB)
- 📜 Implement API Gateway **usage plans and throttling**
